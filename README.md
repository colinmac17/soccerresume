# soccerresu.me

Create a personalized soccer specific resume in minutes and share it with college coaches everywhere.

Our goal is to help coaches and recruits simplify the recruiting process, with fast and easy-to-use software solutions.

As a user, all you need to do is simply add your information to the dashboard and make your profile public. We then generate a custom link for the world to see.

The application is still in beta, future plans include:
 * The ability to record yourself and upload videos with WebRTC
 * The ability to allow users to download your resume as a PDF
 * The ability for college coaches to set up an account that allows them to favorite players and export them to Google Drive
 * And much, much more!
